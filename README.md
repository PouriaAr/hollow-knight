#### Description:  
The Hollow Knight Fan Page is a comprehensive fan-made website dedicated to the critically acclaimed game *Hollow Knight* and its upcoming sequel *Silksong*. The website is designed to offer fans and newcomers alike an immersive experience by showcasing the main aspects of the game, including its bosses, areas, characters, and lore, while also providing interactive elements like a quiz to test users' knowledge about the game. The primary goal of this project was to create a visually engaging and informative platform that celebrates the rich world of Hallownest and the adventures of the game's iconic characters.  

The website is structured into multiple interconnected pages, each serving a specific purpose. The **Home Page** introduces visitors to the Hollow Knight universe with a large hero image and an introduction text describing the world and the role of the Hollow Knight. It also contains featured links to the other pages, allowing users to quickly navigate to sections such as Bosses, Areas, Quiz, and Silksong. The layout emphasizes clarity and accessibility, making it easy for users to explore the content while maintaining a visually pleasing design.  

The **Bosses Page** is dedicated to showcasing ten of the most notable bosses in Hollow Knight. Each boss is presented with a high-quality image, a descriptive title, and a brief explanation of its combat style and challenges. The design alternates between left and right alignment for images and text to create visual variety and maintain user engagement. This page is intended to provide players with useful insights into the different bosses’ behaviors and strategies, helping both new and experienced players understand the game's combat dynamics better. The descriptions highlight the unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses of each boss, giving fans a deeper appreciation of the game’s design.  

The **Areas Page** presents the various regions found throughout Hallownest. Each area is represented with an image and a short description that captures the environment, key enemies, and unique features. The areas are organized in a visually appealing manner with alternating left and right alignment for text and images, similar to the Bosses Page. From the dark and labyrinthine Deepnest to the sparkling Crystal Peak and the lush Greenpath, the page offers a detailed overview of the game’s diverse environments. Users can explore these sections to gain a better understanding of the game world and plan their gameplay accordingly. This page also helps in appreciating the artistic design and atmosphere that *Hollow Knight* is known for.  

The **Quiz Page** introduces an interactive element to the site, allowing users to test their knowledge about Hollow Knight. The quiz contains ten multiple-choice questions covering the game’s lore, characters, areas, and gameplay mechanics. When users submit their answers, JavaScript logic calculates their score and displays instant feedback, along with an image representing their performance. This feature adds an engaging and educational aspect to the fan page, encouraging users to interact more deeply with the content and reinforcing knowledge about the game. It also demonstrates practical use of JavaScript for interactivity within a web page.  

The **Silksong Page** is dedicated to the highly anticipated sequel, *Hollow Knight: Silksong*. This page includes images of new environments, bosses, and characters introduced in the game. Informative text describes Hornet’s role as the protagonist, the gameplay mechanics, and the overall narrative of the sequel. The page highlights new tools, quests, and over 150 unique enemies, emphasizing the fast-paced and challenging gameplay that fans can expect. The page is designed to build excitement and provide an informative preview of the upcoming game, while maintaining stylistic continuity with the rest of the fan page.  

From a technical standpoint, the website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Bootstrap 5**, ensuring responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. Bootstrap’s grid system and utility classes were used to create organized layouts and visually consistent elements. Custom CSS was applied to enhance typography, colors, spacing, and hover effects, giving the site a unique visual identity while maintaining readability. The interactive quiz functionality is implemented with **JavaScript**, which dynamically evaluates user answers and provides immediate results. Images and media assets are organized into dedicated folders, such as `bosses`, `Areas`, and `npc`, to maintain a clear file structure.  

The project emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and user engagement. Navigation across pages is facilitated through a consistent **navbar** that allows users to move seamlessly between sections. Each page includes relevant headings, images, and descriptive text, providing context and enhancing the user experience. Additionally, the footer on all pages contains copyright information and navigation links back to the home page, ensuring that users always have access to key navigation options.  

In summary, the Hollow Knight Fan Page combines visual appeal, interactive elements, and detailed game information to provide a complete fan experience. While the idea, layout, and content were primarily developed independently, minor guidance was used for certain layout patterns and interactivity implementation. The site successfully integrates images, text, and interactive features to present a rich representation of the *Hollow Knight* universe, serving both as an educational tool for new players and an engaging resource for longtime fans. This project demonstrates a practical application of front-end development skills, including HTML structuring, CSS styling, responsive design, and JavaScript interactivity, while also celebrating the artistry and gameplay of a beloved game series.
